# Advent of Code 2024 🎅

My code for the annual Advent of Code Competition.

We're running it back baby! I have not learned my lesson from last year. This one better be good.

## Favorite problems

06\. [Guard Gallivant](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6)\
15\. [Warehouse Woes](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/15)\
17\. [Chronospatial Computer (Part 1)](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/17)\
21\. [Keypad Conundrum](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/21)\
24\. [Crossed Wires](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/24) (Even though I got two valid answers for part 2 and you have to study input the systems brain in me still enjoyed it.)

## The problems I struggled the most on
09\. [Disk Fragmenter](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/9) (I misread the question for part two 🫠...)

## Least favorite problems
14\. [Restroom Redoubt (Part 2)](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/14) (Wtf is a christmas tree)\
17\. [Chronospatial Computer (Part 2)](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/17) (Stop making us study the input. I want to write general solutions, I don't want to have to find some specific behavior that our edge input does.)
