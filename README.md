# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ…

My code for the annual Advent of Code Competition.

We're running it back baby! I have not learned my lesson from last year. This one better be good.

## Favorite problems

06\. [Guard Gallivant](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/6)\
15\. [Warehouse Woes](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/15)\
17\. [Chronospatial Computer (Part 1)](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/17)

## The problems I struggled the most on
09\. [Disk Fragmenter](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/9) (I misread the question for part two ðŸ« ...)

## Least favorite problems
14\. [Restroom Redoubt (Part 2)](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/14) (Wtf is a christmas tree)\
17\. [Chronospatial Computer (Part 2)](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/17) (Stop making us study the input. I want to write general solutions, I don't want to have to find some specific behavior that our edge input does.)
